------- Grade Planner -------

- The intent here is to build a script that helps you benchmark how you're doing in a course. Eventually, this will be a set of courses. You can:

- See the effect a hypothetical grade on an assignment would have on an overall course grade.

- Figure out what you need to earn on a particular assignment (like an exam) to achieve a given grade in the course.

-This is extremely messy right now and needs lots of cleanup. Implementation not even close to complete.
